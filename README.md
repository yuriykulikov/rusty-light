# rusty-light
awesome flashlight firmware written in rust

## What is it all about
In better times programmers had to write a lot of code themselves.
Need a hasmap? Implement one! Linked list? - better start hacking.
OS? Send an email and get going.

It was fun! Now these days are over. There are libraries for everything.
And it makes sense. We get it. We use libraries at work. It makes sense.

But here we can have some fun. This is all this project is about - get creative!

## Crazy? Yes, please!
There are no limits on overengineering here.

## The IKEA effect
To keep the motiviation up, we are going to use these devices for our daily commute
and, occasionally, a nice bike trip.
